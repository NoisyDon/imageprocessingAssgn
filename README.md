Python program to calssify healthy from herniated discs through machine learning, via the use of MATLAB and Python programming software. 

The main objective of this assignment is to develop an automated system to classify healthy and herniated discs. 
In this assignment, firstly we will extract the region of interest (ROI), follow by determining the features of healthy and herniated disc of MRI images for feature extraction. 
Then an algorithm would be designed to train a support vector machine, which would use machine learning to learn from a model curated from the processed images. 

In this assignment, the MATLAB Version 2022a with image processing toolbox was selected to apply the image enhancement and morphological image processing, thereby study their effects on different dataset of images. 
The input images used were MRI scan images of 32 patients, consisting of 10 patients with healthy lumber discs and 22 patients with herniated lumber discs as well as healthy lumber discs.
